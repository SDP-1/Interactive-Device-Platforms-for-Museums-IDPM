3. What if this specific sword had been captured by British forces?

4. What if no swordsmiths survived during the late Kandyan era?","What-If Question 1

Question: What if the Kandyan Kingdom had lost the 1803 battle?

Scenario : The British first attacked Kandy in 1803 during the Kandyan Wars, establishing a garrison after the city was briefly seized. Although they initially succeeded, disease and local resistance forced their retreat.  British political influence grew through collaboration with Kandyan chiefs, eventually culminating in the Kandyan Convention of 1815, which formally ceded Kandy.

Branches:

Explore rituals lost

- The kastāne was deeply embedded in Kandyan court ritual, its ornate hilt symbolizing royal authority.

- If British rule suppressed the monarchy, many martial and royal ceremonies could be allowed to fade.

- Such suppression would erode the role of the sword as a living symbol of sovereignty.

- Without these rituals, future generations might lose first‑hand connection to the kasthāne’s ceremonial meaning.

Explore colonial impact

- Under British administration, symbols of traditional power like the kastāne may have been reinterpreted or commodified.

- The British already recognized the kastāne as a symbol of rank: silver-hilted kasthānes were noted in use by Kandyan nobility.

- Over time, the sword’s use could shift from a status emblem of a sovereign court to a decorative or colonial prestige object.

- This transformation would reflect how colonial governance reshaped native symbols and authority.

Explore political alliances

- Some Kandyan chiefs could align with the British for pragmatic power, altering traditional hierarchies.

- The kastāne, once a mark of native leadership, might be redefined through collaboration or gift-giving.

- This realignment could reduce its role as an exclusively royal or martial symbol.

- After generations, the kasthāne might be seen more as a relic of historical power than as a living emblem of Kandyan sovereignty.

What-If Question 2

Question: What if the Kasthāne sword design adopted South Indian blade styles?

Scenario: The kastāne is a traditional Sri Lankan ceremonial sword, especially associated with the Kandyan Kingdom, noted for its highly ornate hilts depicting mythical creatures.
Many kasthane blades were actually imported or influenced by European metallurgy, showing how foreign styles were already integrated in Kandyan weapons.

Branches:

See craft differences

- Kandyan smiths would need to adapt forging techniques for different blade geometry.

- Hilt motifs—lions, makaras, yali—could merge with stylistic elements common in South Indian swords.

- The result could be a hybrid sword reflecting both Kandyan and South Indian traditions.

- Over time, purists might debate whether these remain “authentic” kasthānes or a new hybrid form.

Explore ritual adaptations

- Changes in blade balance or curvature would affect how the sword is carried or used in ceremonies.

- Ritual dances or martial demonstrations might evolve, modifying grips and movement.

- Traditional symbolic meanings tied to the original kasthāne form could shift or be reinterpreted.

- New ritual patterns may emerge, blending Kandyan and South Indian practices.

Compare regional swords

- This branch could present side-by-side examples of kastānes and South Indian ceremonial swords, highlighting stylistic differences.

- Historical trade and cultural exchange make such design blending plausible.

- Users can explore how the kasthāne is part of a broader South Asian tradition, not a wholly isolated artifact.

- It illustrates the dynamic nature of material culture, how it evolves through influence.

What-If Question 3

Question: What if this sword had been captured by British forces?

Scenario: Provenance research shows that some ornate kastāne swords (e.g., with gold hilts) ended up in European collections, possibly as spoils of war or gifts during Kandyan-Dutch or Kandyan-British conflicts. These swords weren’t purely weapons but symbols of status and power in Kandyan court life.

Branches:

View similar artifacts taken to Europe

- There are documented kastāne swords in European museums, such as gold or silver-hilted examples cataloged by colonial provenance researchers.

- These swords serve as historical testimonies to how colonial powers collected local symbols of authority.

- Users could explore catalog records, images, and the stories these swords carried far from Sri Lanka.

- This branch shows how a culturally significant item can become part of a global colonial legacy.

Learn about colonial collections

- Colonial-era documentation (e.g., the Colonial Collections Committee) reports how kasthānes were cataloged, gifted, or confiscated.

- These swords often became trophies or diplomatic gifts, recontextualized in European settings.

- Their symbolic role shifted from royal regalia to museum objects.

- This branch helps users understand power dynamics and how colonial collecting reshaped cultural meaning.

Explore repatriation debates

-  Modern provenance research raises ethical questions about returning cultural heritage to Sri Lanka.

- The kastāne, being a royal symbol, is central to debates on cultural restitution.

- Repatriation could reconnect these swords with their original community context.

- This branch links historical colonialism to contemporary heritage justice and ownership.

What-If Question 4

Question: What if no swordsmiths survived in the late Kandyan era?

Scenario: Kastāne swords were crafted in the Kandyan kingdom’s royal workshops (pattal hatara), where skilled artisans worked with metals, gemstones, and mythical motifs.
After the fall of the Kandyan Kingdom, traditional patronage declined significantly, contributing to erosion in craft knowledge.

Branches:

See endangered Sri Lankan crafts

- When royal and noble patronage waned, many traditional crafts—including sword-making—suffered decline.

- Artisan lineages could break, losing knowledge of intricate carving, inlay, and motif design.

- The kasthāne’s elaborate hilts (lion, makara, yali) reflect a high level of craft that would be hard to fully reconstruct.

- This branch opens a discussion on how heritage craft survives or disappears without its makers.

Explore metalworking history

- The kasthāne’s hilt is often made of gilded or silvered metal and sometimes inlaid with precious stones, showing expert metalworking.

- Benchtop or royal workshops (“Rankadu Pattala”) produced these swords, indicating institutional craft infrastructure.

- If no swordsmiths remained, this specialized knowledge (casting, inlay, mythical carving) could be lost.

- This branch gives users insight into the technical and artistic tradition behind the kasthāne’s creation.

Revival and legacy

- Even with loss, modern artisans and historians study existing kastānes (in museums or private collections) to reconstruct traditional methods.

- Reproductions or heritage projects may revive original designs and techniques.

- These efforts reflect how cultural memory can be preserved through scholarship and craft revival.

- This branch highlights resilience: even if craft almost died out, the kasthāne’s legacy can still be reclaimed."
ART002,Kandyan Mural Painting,Religious Wall Art,Kandyan Era,1700–1800,Temple of the Tooth / Degaldoruwa Temple,"Kandyan murals depict Buddhist religious scenes using natural pigments. They illustrate Jataka tales, floral motifs, and distinctive Kandyan visual styles.

4. What if this mural had been destroyed during temple renovations?","What‑If Question 1

Question: What if the mural had never been restored?

Scenario: Kandyan murals are painted on white‑smoothed walls (using “makulu” clay) and use natural pigments (like plant extracts and minerals).
Over time, these colors fade due to moisture, environmental effects, and lack of maintenance.
Sunday Observer

Branches:

Explore fading iconography

- Without restoration, many of the vibrant Jataka scenes  such as Vessantara or Mara Parajaya would gradually lose clarity.

- Key figures, floral motifs, and narrative borders would become faint or unrecognizable.

- The educational and devotional value of the murals would suffer, as worshippers and visitors can no longer clearly see the stories.

- Over generations, the visual connection to Kandyan-era Buddhist teaching and royal patronage would weaken.

Investigate conservation loss

- The degradation of mural paint could lead to structural damage, as plaster and organic pigments deteriorate.

- Without intervention, even the wall surface (the “makulu” coating) could crumble, risking loss of entire mural sections.

- Historical techniques and artistry would become harder to study for historians and conservators.

- Future generations might only have photographic or archival records  not the original painted walls  to learn from.

Examine impact on cultural tourism

- Faded or damaged murals could reduce the temple’s appeal to cultural visitors and pilgrims.

- Temple authorities might struggle to justify investments in heritage tourism if murals no longer impress.

- Loss of mural quality could diminish the community’s pride in their Kandyan heritage.

- Over time, the temple might risk being seen more as a historical ruin than a living artistic and religious site.

What‑If Question 2

Question: What if the original artist never completed the painting?

Scenario: Historical records (e.g., Degaldoruwa Temple) note that a team of artists  including Devaragampola Silvattena  worked on Jataka murals.
The Kandyan “school” of painting emphasized clean outlines, flat color planes, and structured narrative registers.

Branches:

Unfinished narrative panels

- Some Jataka tales or episodes would be only partially depicted, leaving scenes incomplete.

- Viewers and worshippers might not fully understand the moral or spiritual lessons intended.

- The absence of finished narrative structure could affect how the stories are told or taught.

- The temple’s artistic prestige might suffer, as the unfinished works would lack the power of a completed visual cycle.

Artistic legacy disrupted

- Later generations of mural painters might lack a complete template or reference to replicate or continue the style.

- The original artist’s vision, techniques, and compositional plan could be lost.

- Without clear finished works, the lineage of the Kandyan painting school could be weakened.

- Restoration or revival efforts might be based on guesswork rather than authentic master designs.

Religious and ritual impact

- The murals are not just decorative  they are part of temple storytelling and religious education.

- If key visual stories are missing or incomplete, the ritual or devotional experience could feel fragmented.

- Pilgrims and students may find it harder to connect with certain Buddhist teachings depicted on the walls.

- Over time, the temple’s role as a visual scripture (through murals) could be compromised.

What‑If Question 3

Question: What if foreign pigments were used instead of natural Kandyan pigments?

Scenario:
Kandyan artists traditionally used natural pigments  derived from plants, fruits, and minerals  mixed with binders like wood gum.
Later, during colonial period or revival periods, foreign (chemical) pigments became more widely available and sometimes used.

Branches:

Color authenticity compromised

- Foreign chemical pigments might produce brighter or unnatural hues not typical of Kandyan-style murals.

- The traditional limited palette (red, yellow, green, white, black, gold, blue) might be replaced with more saturated or diverse tones.

- Such changes could alter visual harmony and symbolic color meaning.

- The murals could lose some of their cultural authenticity, making them feel less “traditional Kandyan.”

Faster degradation risk

- Synthetic pigments may react differently to humidity, temperature, and moisture than natural ones.

- Chemical pigments could flake, fade, or deteriorate more quickly in Sri Lanka’s tropical climate.

- Maintenance and restoration costs might increase, as newer pigments require different treatment.

- Over time, the mural’s condition could degrade in ways not anticipated by traditional conservators.

Artistic technique shift

- Using foreign pigments could require changes in painting technique (e.g., mixing, brushwork).

- New painters may rely on modern materials rather than mastering traditional methods.

- The result could be a stylistic departure from Kandyan school painting — not just in color but in execution.

- This shift could lead to a new hybrid mural tradition, but might overshadow the original Kandyan style.

What‑If Question 4

Question: What if this mural had been destroyed during temple renovations?

Scenario: Degaldoruwa Temple, built in 1771 under King Kirti Sri Rajasinha, has its cave‑shrine ceiling and walls fully decorated with Kandyan Jataka murals by master artists.
Kandyan murals are especially vulnerable because they are painted on plastered walls (clay plaster base) that can be damaged during structural renovation.

Branches:

Loss of historical narrative

- Entire panels of Jataka stories could be destroyed, erasing centuries of visual storytelling.

- The connection between the temple’s architecture and its religious teachings would weaken.

- Scholars and worshippers would lose direct access to historical episodes and moral lessons.

- Reconstructing lost murals would be difficult without detailed records or references.

Cultural memory disruption

- Community identity tied to the temple’s art would suffer; murals are part of the living heritage.

- Future generations might only know the stories via texts, not through immersive visual experience.

- The loss could diminish the temple’s role as a place of education and pilgrimage.

- Without the original artistic work, the site might feel less authentic or spiritually resonant.

Restoration vs reconstruction debate

- If murals are destroyed, restoration would involve reconstruction based on photos, sketches, or memory — which may be inaccurate.

- There could be debates over whether to recreate in the original style or use a modern interpretation.

- Ethical questions would arise: should new murals be considered “heritage” or “copy”?

- This branch highlights how heritage decisions can shape the future of cultural sites."
ART003,Kolam Mask (Traditional Dance Mask),Folk Drama Mask,18th century (1700s) – Present,1735 – Present,Southern Sri Lanka (Ambalangoda),"Used in Kolam dance dramas blending humor, satire, and folklore. Traditionally carved from kaduru wood. Kolam performances include characters such as kings, queens, village elders, demons, and social caricatures.","Communicate stories, moral lessons, and entertainment in village performances.",Vital element in Sri Lanka’s intangible cultural heritage; preserved through families like the Ambalangoda mask-makers (Tukka Wadu lineage).,"Kolam festivals, mask-making traditions of Ambalangoda, folk theatre preservation efforts.","1. What if Kolam mask-making never spread beyond Ambalangoda?

2. What if Kolam were never integrated into healing and ritual ceremonies (like Shanthi or Tovil)?

3. What if modern tourism turned Kolam masks into purely decorative objects?","What‑If Question 1

Question: What if Kolam mask‑making never spread to villages beyond Ambalangoda?

Scenario: Mask making in Sri Lanka has historically been centered in Ambalangoda, a major craft hub with multi-generational artisan lineages.
The Tukka Wadu family from Ambalangoda has preserved the traditional Kolam mask carving and performance for centuries.
If mask-making had remained confined, its reach into rural communities could have been limited, reducing local variation and the spread of Kolam theatre.

Branches:

Artistic Homogeneity

- With mask-making restricted to Ambalangoda, styles would likely remain uniform, lacking regional adaptation or variation.

- Local folk creativity in villages wouldn’t feed into the design of new characters or motifs.

- The rich diversity of Kolam masks (humans, animals, mythical beings) might stay limited to a narrow canon.

- Over time, Kolam’s visual tradition could stagnate, making it less dynamic.

Decline in Rural Storytelling

- Villages without mask-making traditions might not develop their own Kolam dance‑dramas.

- Important folk characters, satire, and local moral episodes might never emerge in village performances.

- Kolam theatre could remain a performance restricted to Ambalangoda, losing its grassroots social commentary.

- The communal, participatory nature of Kolam in rural life would be weakened.

Economic and Cultural Impact

- Families in other villages would miss out on craft-based livelihoods tied to mask carving.

- Transmission of mask-making skills would remain limited to Ambalangoda lineages.

- Without village centers, the artisan economy would concentrate, reducing broader craft sustainability.

- Kolam’s role in healing rituals, festivals, and community identity outside Ambalangoda would be diminished.

What‑If Question 2

Question: What if Kolam were never integrated into healing and ritual ceremonies (like Shanthi or Tovil)?

Scenario: Kolam performances have traditionally been associated with ritual healing practices (Shanthi Karma) in Sri Lanka’s southwest coastal region.
Masks in Kolam drama are deeply symbolic, with characters (like demons or spirits) believed to connect with healing, well‑being, and protecting communities.

Branches:

Loss of Ritual Meaning

- Without its role in healing ceremonies, Kolam masks could lose much of their symbolic potency.

- Performances might become purely entertainment, not tools for spiritual or communal healing.

- The tradition’s depth and sacredness might be perceived as shallower.

- Over generations, the mask’s function as a mediator between community and unseen forces could fade.

Reduced Performance Frequency

- Healing rituals often provide occasions for Kolam performances, encouraging regular community engagement.

- Without these ritual contexts, Kolam shows could become rare and mainly for cultural festivals.

- Artisans may find fewer reasons (or audiences) to maintain traditional characters.

- The loss of regular performance opportunities could shrink the tradition’s living practice.

Change in Narratives and Characters

- Ritual Kolam often includes characters that represent spirits, demons, or moral archetypes tied to illness or cosmic forces.

- If healing is removed, these characters might be replaced or simplified to suit entertainment contexts.

- The rich symbolic meaning of some masks could be lost or reinterpreted.

- Kolam drama might become more standardized and less tied to local belief systems.

What‑If Question 3

Question: What if modern tourism turned Kolam masks into purely decorative objects?

Scenario: Ambalangoda’s mask industry faces pressure from tourism, where masks are produced for sale to visitors rather than for performance.
Some traditional practitioners worry that Kolam masks are being made primarily for display and souvenirs, losing their ritual and performance value.
Los Angeles Times

Branches:

Commercialization Over Tradition

- Masks become more focused on tourist appeal than cultural authenticity.

- Designs might simplify or exaggerate to sell better, losing traditional symbolism.

- Performance-related features (balance, fit, expressiveness) could be sacrificed for aesthetics.

- Over time, Kolam masks may be appreciated more as decorative crafts than living cultural artifacts.

Decline in Performance Practice

- If making masks for sale is more profitable, fewer artisans might carve for performance.

- Kolam performances may decline as mask production shifts to a souvenir industry.

- The storytelling and social critique embedded in traditional Kolam could be lost.

- Younger generations may join the craft for income, not for cultural preservation.

Heritage Preservation Challenges

- Museums and cultural centers may struggle to maintain traditional Kolam as an art form, beyond commercial replicas.

- The ritual and symbolic roles of masks (e.g., in healing) risk being forgotten.

- Efforts to revive or document Kolam traditions could focus on aesthetics, not performance.

- The deeper intangible heritage (community practices, ritual meaning, mask-making knowledge) may erode."
ART004,Traditional Clay Pot (Sri Lankan Earthenware),Domestic Craft / Pottery,Pre-Colonial to Present,1000 BCE – Present,"Sri Lanka (e.g., Anuradhapura, Hambantota, Kurunegala)","Clay pottery has been used in Sri Lanka for millennia  for cooking, water storage, and rituals. Early civilizations used hand-coiled or wheel-turned clay vessels made from local red clay.","Cooking, storing water, carrying grains, and use in religious rituals.","Represents daily life, sustainability, and the craft tradition of village potters.","Ancient hydraulic civilization (tanks, rice cultivation), pottery trade, ritual festivals.","1. What if traditional clay pot-making had ceased after colonial metalware became common?

2. What if ancient clay pots were not used in ritual or religious contexts?

3. What if Sri Lankan potters switched entirely to modern kilns and materials, abandoning traditional red clay?

4. What if pottery traditions had never been documented or preserved, and the knowledge had been lost?","What-If Question 1

Question: What if traditional clay pot-making had ceased after colonial metalware became common?

Scenario: According to the International Research Centre for Intangible Cultural Heritage (IRCI), Sri Lanka’s potters continue to use red clay, hand throwing or wheel-making, and primitive kilns, but face severe competition from metal utensils.
The domestic clay-pot tradition is deeply embedded in village economies and daily life.

Branches:

Loss of rural livelihoods

- If pot-making declined, many village families would lose a key source of income.

- Traditional potters (badahelayo) would no longer pass down their craft to the next generation.

- Clay artisans’ social status could diminish without the steady demand for clay ware.

- Over time, the craft’s disappearance would weaken local cultural identity tied to pottery.

Dependence on industrial goods

- Communities would increasingly rely on metal, plastic, or imported cookware.

- Domestic rituals and storage practices would adapt to different materials, losing clay’s symbolic role.

- The shift could reduce sustainability, as metal/industrial goods wear or rust, and aren’t biodegradable like clay.

- Clay pots’ absence would disconnect people from a tactile, traditional way of life rooted in earth.

Heritage fade & revival difficulty

- Without daily practice, the traditional knowledge of clay selection, shaping, and firing could be lost.

- Future heritage revival would rely only on museum pieces or documentation — not living practice.

- Reconstructing ancient techniques would be harder without continuity, affecting authenticity.

- This branch underscores how fragile living cultural crafts become when economic pressures shift.

What-If Question 2

Question: What if ancient clay pots were not used in ritual or religious contexts?

Scenario: Sri Lankan earthenware has been used for both utilitarian and ceremonial purposes; terracotta vessels served in religious roles in ancient times.
Pottery shards from Anuradhapura show that vessels were part of ritual and domestic life.

Branches:

Reduced symbolic meaning

- If clay pots lacked ritual use, they might be seen purely as mundane items, not sacred or symbolic.

- Their role in offerings, alms bowls, or temple kitchens would disappear.

- This could weaken the connection between everyday craft and spiritual life.

- Pottery might then lose some of its cultural importance, becoming utilitarian rather than heritage.

Less frequent pot production

- Ritual demand often sustains craft cycles (e.g., making special pots for festivals).

- Without religious use, the volume and variety of pots made could decrease.

- Pottery workshops might shrink or consolidate, leading to fewer potter families.

- Villages would lose a recurring cultural reason to produce and preserve traditional clay ware.

Purely functional evolution

- Clay pots would evolve in form and function strictly for cooking and storage.

- Decorative or symbolic variants (like ritual urns or painted pots) might not develop.

- The aesthetic diversity of Sri Lankan pottery could shrink in favor of practicality.

- Over time, pottery might become less of an art form and more of a basic household utility.

What-If Question 3

Question: What if Sri Lankan potters switched entirely to modern kilns and materials, abandoning traditional red clay?

Scenario: IRCI reports that many potters still use traditional kilns made of bricks or stones, and red clay sourced from local soils.
Explore Sri Lanka describes how potters refine red clay, sometimes mixing with other materials, and fire in primitive kilns; this tradition continues in many areas.

Branches:

Loss of material authenticity

- Using high-tech kilns or different clay (e.g., imported mixes) could change the traditional texture, porosity, and color of pots.

- The distinctive red clay earthenware – a hallmark of Sri Lankan domestic pottery – might be replaced by uniform, mass-produced ceramics.

- This shift would dilute cultural identity embedded in the clay itself.

- Future generations may not recognize the look, feel, or smell of traditional earthenware.

Industrialization of craft

- Pottery could become a factory-based craft rather than a hand-made village tradition.

- Economic benefits might increase, but the personal, family-based nature of pottery would decline.

- The craft’s social and communal aspects — shared through generations — may weaken.

- The result would be efficient production, but at the cost of living heritage and artisanal knowledge.

Environmental and health trade-offs

- Modern kilns might use fossil fuels or energy-intensive firing, increasing environmental cost.

- Traditional clay pots offer health benefits (e.g., cooking in clay is said to retain flavor and nutrients).
Explore Sri Lanka

- Switching could mean losing a more sustainable, low-energy craft.

- Communities might face a moral balance: economic gain vs ecological and cultural loss.

What-If Question 4

Question: What if pottery traditions had never been documented or preserved, and the knowledge had been lost?

Scenario : Archaeological excavations (Anuradhapura and other sites) have revealed earthenware pottery across centuries, showing a continuous tradition.
The Explore Sri Lanka site explains that potters historically passed down their techniques from clay preparation to wheel-turning  through family lineages.
Explore Sri Lanka

Branches:

Complete craft extinction

- Without documentation or oral transmission, traditional potting techniques (coiling, wheel turning) could vanish.

- Crucial technical knowledge — how to prepare local clay, how to fire in primitive kilns — would be lost.

- Future generations would lack the means to revive historically accurate earthenware.

- Pottery’s role in cultural memory would fade, reducing living heritage to archaeological relics.

Heritage revival becomes symbolic

- Attempts to revive pottery would rely solely on shards, museum pieces, and written reports.

- Without living practitioners, recreated clay pots might lack the traditional feel, proportions, or function.

- The revived craft could become more of a museum activity than a community practice.

- Pottery could be preserved as history rather than a living, everyday craft.

Loss of cultural continuity

- Pottery is deeply tied to daily life and rituals in Sri Lanka. Losing craft knowledge would break that continuity.

- Cultural values linked to clay — such as humility, connection to earth, and sustainability — could diminish.

- Craftspeople’s role in village societies (as providers of essential pottery) would disappear.

- Entire communities might lose a meaningful link to their ancestors, expressed through the humble clay pot."
ART005,Traditional Sri Lankan Drum (Geta Bera / Yak Bera),Musical Instrument / Drum,Pre‑colonial to Present,Ancient Sri Lanka (3rd century BCE) – Present,Sri Lanka (Kandy / Up‑country for Geta Bera; Low-country / Ruhunu for Yak Bera),"The Geta Bera (also Udarata Beraya) is a double-headed, barrel-shaped drum used in Kandyan dance.

Yak Bera (Low-country drum) is used in Ruhunu (low-country) dance traditions, often in ritual and mask dance contexts.

Drum-making traditions are preserved in villages like Kuragala, where artisans carve the body from local timber and stretch skins for the drum heads.","Provide rhythm and accompaniment for dance, ritual, and ceremony (especially Kandyan dance, exorcism, and low-country dances)","Key element in Sri Lankan dance heritage; symbolic instrument in Buddhist ritual, folk dance, and community identity.","Kandyan dance performances, Buddhist temple ceremonies, low‑country exorcism rituals, drumming festivals.","1.

3. What if the double-skin design of the Geta Bera (with different animal skins) was altered or standardized?

4.What if drumming castes (like the Berava) no longer studied or passed on Geta/Yak Bera traditions?","What‑If Question 1

Question: What if traditional drum-making for the Geta Bera and Yak Bera declined in artisan villages like Kuragala?

Scenario: Kuragala (in Kandy) is a well-known drum-making village where families carve Geta Bera and Yak Bera using locally sourced timber and traditional skins.
meer.com Piyasara Shilapadhipathi notes that while there were historically ~33 types of drums, today only around ten remain in common use, including the Geta and Yak Bera.
Theatre Room Asia

Branches:

Loss of Musical Heritage

- If artisan villages decline, the knowledge of how to craft these traditional barrel‑drums could fade.

- The unique tonal quality of these drums—two differently pitched heads—might be lost.

- Future drummers may have to rely on imported or mass-produced drums.

- This loss would weaken the connection between traditional dance and authentic sound.

Reduced Ritual Use

- Without well-made traditional drums, many ritual dances (e.g., Kandyan, low-country) could lose their rhythmic backbone.

- Drumming in temple ceremonies and peraheras might become less authentic or rely on substitutes.

- The symbolic power of the drum, tied to ritual and identity, can diminish.

- Over time, the absence of real geta or yak bera could erode performance traditions.

Economic Disruption

- Families in drum-making villages could lose their livelihood.

- Younger generations may leave the craft and abandon the village trade.

- The socio-economic fabric of these artisan communities would suffer.

- Cultural tourism tied to traditional drumming might decline, affecting local economies.

What‑If Question 2

Question: What if Geta Bera and Yak Bera were replaced by modern percussion instruments in dance performances?

Scenario: The Geta Bera is fundamental to Kandyan dance, producing two tones (low and high) via different drumheads.
Sri Lankan traditional dancing and drumming workshops note the importance of these drums in classical dance and Buddhist ceremonies.
kstatemtd.com

Branches:

Loss of Traditional Sound

- Modern percussion instruments (e.g., electronic drums or Western-style drums) would produce very different tones.

- The subtle pitch contrast from the two differently skinned heads would be lost.

- Dance performances would lack the authentic rhythmic texture characteristic of traditional Sri Lankan dance.

- Audiences may feel a gap in cultural continuity, hearing more “generic” beats than heritage rhythms.

Simplified Dance Patterns

- Without the complex rhythms, dancers might adapt or simplify choreography to match the new percussion.

- Traditional time signatures and rhythmic motifs could disappear or be altered.

- Innovations might dilute the connection between percussion technique and dance form.

- Over time, classic dance traditions may evolve into something less rooted in historical rhythm.

Cultural Commodification

- Modern instruments might make performances more accessible for international tours or commercial shows.

- But the cultural meaning of the geta and yak bera could be reduced to “props” rather than living heritage.

- Drumming could become more about spectacle than ritual or community identity.

- Long-term, this shift may undermine efforts to preserve traditional percussion craft.

What‑If Question 3

Question: What if the double-skin design of the Geta Bera (with different animal skins) was altered or standardized?

Scenario :
According to Lakpura, the Geta Beraya uses two different skins: treated cattle hide on one side and goat (or monkey) skin on the other, creating different pitch levels.
Drum‑makers in Sri Lanka historically used locally available woods like ehela, kohomba, or kos for drum bodies.

Branches:

Sound Uniformity

- If only one type of skin is used, the distinctive dual-tone sound may vanish.

- The drum’s capacity for tonal variation (low + high) would be lost, reducing its musical flexibility.

- Rhythmic expression in dance accompaniment could become less dynamic.

- A less nuanced drum might undermine its role as a central instrument in traditional dance.

Material Sustainability Pressure

- Replacing traditional skins might push makers toward synthetic or easily-sourced materials.

- This could degrade the natural resonance derived from the original hides.

- While possibly cheaper, synthetic materials may not provide the same cultural authenticity.

- Over generations, traditional drum-making knowledge (how to select hides, treat them) might die out.

Craft Tradition Weakening

- Drum artisans would lose a key part of their craft expertise: tuning two skins differently.

- New makers might lack experience with how to balance skin tension for each side.

- The traditional 12-element drum learning exercises (as mentioned in classical teaching) could change.

- Loss of these skills would weaken transmission of heritage drumming techniques.

What‑If Question 4

Question: What if drumming castes (like the Berava) no longer studied or passed on Geta/Yak Bera traditions?

Scenario: In Sri Lanka, the art of playing traditional drums such as Geta Bera and Yak Bera has been historically associated with male artists in drumming castes (Berava).
Ethnographic studies note that the craft, playing, and making of these drums are inherited, often from family — such as in the village of Manikhinna, where a drummer’s family has passed down drum manufacture.

Branches:

Break in Lineage

If the drumming caste stops teaching younger generations, the technique and craftsmanship may fade.

Drummers would lack mentors, disrupting the deep learning of traditional rhythms.

Over time, the unique skill set for playing these historical drums could vanish.

This would threaten not just performance, but the social structure and respect tied to drummers.

Cultural Ritual Disruption

- Drumming for dance and temple ceremonies may decline without trained traditional drummers.

- Rituals and dances (e.g., Esala Perahera) that rely on precise drumming could lose quality or authenticity.

- The symbolic role of these drums in temple life would diminish.

- Communities might find substitute percussionists, but with less cultural depth.

Migration to Commercial Performance

- Younger members may be more likely to join drumming troupes for tourist shows rather than ritual contexts.

- The traditional repertoire (ritual rhythms, time signatures) could be simplified to suit commercial audiences.

Question: What if the moonstone carvings had been destroyed during foreign invasions or centuries of neglect?

Scenario: Over centuries, due to war, looting, environmental wear, or neglect, many of the original Polonnaruwa moonstones are lost or damaged beyond recognition.

Branches:

Loss of Religious‑Symbolic Heritage

- Devotees and visitors would lose a tangible, visual representation of Buddhist teachings regarding samsāra and liberation — making entrance rites purely physical, not symbolic.

- New generations would lack a direct link to ancient Buddhist visual philosophy — reducing lived understanding of heritage.

- Temples would lose a key element that connects architecture with moral/spiritual narrative, weakening religious ambiance.

- Written texts might survive, but the experiential, symbolic engagement through art would be irretrievably lost.

Break in Artistic Tradition

- Stone‑carving skill specific to moonstone motifs could be interrupted; apprentices lack models to learn from.

- Over time, Sinhalese sculptural tradition might diverge, or become diluted, leading to loss of unique national style.

- Contributions to regional identity and craftsmanship history would be truncated, making reconstruction speculative.

- Heritage‑craft knowledge becomes fragmented; revival efforts would rely on incomplete records or modern reinterpretations.

Cultural Memory Erosion

- Moonstone symbolism might fade from public consciousness; fewer people would know the meaning behind the motifs.

- Cultural tourism value of Polonnaruwa and other ancient sites would diminish without signature sculptural elements.

- Local pride and connection to ancestral heritage could weaken — affecting community identity.

- Scholarly study of Buddhist‑era stone art would be hindered — limiting understanding of historical aesthetics, values, and beliefs.

What‑If Question 2

Question: What if Polonnaruwa artisans had adopted foreign (non‑Sinhalese) stone‑carving styles instead of retaining traditional moonstone motifs?

Scenario: Suppose during Polonnaruwa the craftsmen started using carving styles imported from South India or Southeast Asia — altering motif choices, proportions, or replacing Buddhist symbolic motifs with foreign decorative motifs.

Branches:

Hybrid Art Forms Emerge

- Moonstones might blend Buddhist symbolism with foreign iconography — creating a syncretic architectural style unique to that era.

- This hybridization could reflect a multicultural polity, attracting scholarly attention and broadening the meaning of temple art.

- Over time, a new tradition may form, recognized as a distinct “Polonnaruwa‑international” style — influencing future generations.

- Temples might appeal to a broader cultural constituency, reflecting diverse influences.

Loss of Symbolic Coherence

- Replacing symbolic bands (animals, flames, lotus) with decorative motifs may obscure the original Buddhist message — confusing devotees.

- Over generations, the meaning behind entrance‑carvings would fade; moonstones become mere decoration rather than spiritual guides.

- The unified symbolic language shared across Sinhalese Buddhist architecture might fragment — reducing cultural cohesion.

- Later generations may misinterpret or lose the moral/spiritual context that once came with entering a temple.

Decline in Traditional Craftsmanship

- Local stone‑carving techniques optimized for moonstone motifs might be abandoned — leading to loss of specialized skill sets.

- Traditional artisans may be replaced by craftsmen trained in foreign styles — diminishing indigenous craftsmanship.

- Knowledge transfer across generations (motifs, symbolism, technique) could break — affecting cultural continuity.

- Restoration or conservation of older moonstones might become difficult due to lack of trained local artisans familiar with original designs.

What‑If Question 3

Question: What if moonstones had been mass‑produced for secular or common buildings (houses, palaces, civic buildings), not reserved only for temples?

Scenario: In Polonnaruwa (or later periods), moonstone designs become popular beyond religious sites — used in palaces, homes of nobles, public buildings as decorative flooring or entrance stones.

Branches:

Wider Cultural Dissemination

- The symbolism of samsāra and spiritual teachings would permeate daily life, embedding Buddhist moral ideas into everyday architecture.

- Ordinary people (not just religious practitioners) would engage with symbolic art — raising broader cultural and spiritual awareness.

- Artistic literacy regarding traditional motifs might increase across classes and regions.

- Moonstone craftsmanship and demand could rise — sustaining stone sculpture as a living craft.

Dilution of Sacred Significance

- Repeated use in mundane buildings might strip moonstones of their sacred connotation — reducing spiritual reverence.

- Over time, people may view moonstones as mere decorative flooring rather than sacred thresholds.

- Temples might lose the uniqueness of moonstone symbolism — reducing spiritual distinction between sacred and secular spaces.

- The act of entering a temple may lose the intended symbolic transition from worldly to spiritual domain.

Evolution of Design and Technique

- To suit secular architecture, artisans might simplify or stylize moonstone motifs — adjusting size, motifs, or materials for practicality or cost.

- New regional variants may emerge, reflecting local tastes or economic constraints — leading to diversification of designs.

- Stone‑working could shift from specialized temple workshops to local or home-level artisanship — democratizing craft but possibly reducing quality.

- Over time, moonstone art might evolve away from classical symbolism into more decorative or utilitarian stonework.

What‑If Question 4

Question: What if the symbolic motifs (animals, swans, creeper, flames, lotus) on moonstones were replaced by purely abstract or geometric decorative patterns, discarding their Buddhist symbolism?

Scenario: Due to changing aesthetics, political shifts, or loss of religious context, temple builders choose abstract or purely decorative patterns instead of traditional animal‑ and symbol‑based bands.

Branches:

Loss of Doctrinal Representation

- The moonstone would lose its function as a visual representation of Buddhist teachings — becoming devoid of narrative meaning.

- Visitors and devotees would no longer receive moral reminders via architecture — reducing temples to physical structures only.

- Over generations, communal memory of moral symbolism could fade; the deeper spiritual context would vanish.

- Future restoration or conservation efforts would lack understanding of original meaning — risking misinterpretation or neglect of heritage values.

Shift towards Aesthetic‑Centric Architecture

- Temples may focus on symmetry, color, and form over symbolic meaning — reflecting changing tastes or external influences.

- Architecture becomes more about visual appeal or status rather than spiritual message — possibly attracting different (not purely religious) visitors.

- Artistic exchange with other cultures might increase, introducing new decorative vocabularies.

- Moonstones might be valued for craftsmanship alone, not their spiritual content.

Disconnect between Architecture and Religion

- The threshold into sacred spaces loses its ritual significance — becoming similar to any ordinary building entrance.

- Religious education via art disappears — reducing temples to liturgical function only (no embedded teaching).

- Younger generations raised with abstract motifs may not realise the historical significance of earlier symbolic moonstones.

- Over time, original moonstones may be regarded as obsolete or irrelevant — risking neglect or demolition."
